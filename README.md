# Cross-EOF-Eddy-Feedback-Model (Lubis and Hassanzadeh, 2021; JAS)

We developed a reduced-order model for coupled EOF1 and EOF2 that accounts for potential cross-EOF eddy-zonal flow feedbacks for propagating annular modes. Using the analytical solution of this model, we derive conditions for the existence of the propagating regime based on the feedback strengths.
