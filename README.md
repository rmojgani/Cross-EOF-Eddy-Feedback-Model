# An Eddy-Zonal Flow Feedback Model for Propagating Annular Modes

We introduce a reduced-order model for coupled EOF1 and EOF2 that accounts for potential cross-EOF eddy-zonal flow feedbacks for propagating annular modes. Using the analytical solution of this model, we derive conditions for the existence of the propagating regime based on the feedback strengths.

The detail of the model can be found here (see Section 3):
